# About This Book

`mod_rewrite` is one of the most powerful, and least understood, of the
modules that are provided with the Apache HTTP Server. It is frequently
misused to do things that can be done so much better other ways.

This book is intended to help you understand `mod_rewrite` deeply, so
that you know when and how to use it, as well as when not to use it, and
what to use instead.
