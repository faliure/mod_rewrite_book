## Recipes

In this chapter, we'll present various common problems, and a variety of
ways to solve them using `mod_rewrite`, or one of the other tools
discussed in this book.

Some of these recipes have already been presented in other parts of the
book, but are gathered here to make it easier to find them. We'll also
expand, in detail, how they work, and when you might want to use one
solution versus another.
